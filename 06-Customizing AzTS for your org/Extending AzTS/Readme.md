We have shared AzTS and its documentation with the community to provide guidance for rapidly scanning, deploying and operationalizing cloud resources, across the different stages of DevOps, while maintaining controls on security and governance.

Currently you can extend AzTS controls set by either adding a new control based on custom Azure Policy or based on Azure Security Center assessment.
