## 211015 (AzTS)

### Feature updates

* Control & Remediation Scripts Development:
    * Bulk Remediation Scripts:
    The bulk remediation scripts for controls mentioned below have been released & can be accessed from the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/azsk/AzTS-docs/tree/main/Scripts/RemediationScripts).
        1. Azure_SQLDatabase_DP_Enable_TDE
        2. Azure_Storage_DP_Encrypt_In_Transit
        3. Azure_APIManagement_DP_Use_HTTPS_URL_Scheme

        **Note:** Currently we have focused on auto remediations that are relatively less risky to remediate & do not lead to any  application downtime like scenarios. 

    * Security Verification Tests (SVTs):
    6 Non-Baseline controls have been added to Azure Tenant Scanner. Non baseline controls are those controls that have been implemented in AzTS as a part of effort to migrate all feasible controls from DevOps Kit (AzSK).
    1. Azure_RedisCache_BCDR_Use_RDB_Backup
    2. Azure_HDInsight_NetSec_Restrict_Cluster_Network_Access
    3. Azure_AppService_AuthN_Use_Managed_Service_Identity
    4. Azure_AppService_DP_Restrict_CORS_Access
    5. Azure_RedisCache_DP_Use_Secure_TLS_Version
    6. Azure_Subscription_AuthZ_Dont_Use_NonAD_Identities_Privileged_Roles
