# 211115 (AzTS)

## Feature Updates

### Security Controls Updates
* 2 Non Baseline controls have been added to Azure Tenant Scanner. Non baseline controls are those controls that have been implemented in AzTS as a part of effort to migrate all feasible controls from DevOps Kit (AzSK).

    * [Azure_DBforPostgreSQL_AuthZ_Firewall_Deny_AzureServices_Access](https://github.com/azsk/AzTS-docs/blob/main/Control%20coverage/Feature/DBForPostgreSQL.md#azure_dbforpostgresql_authz_firewall_deny_azureservices_access)
    * [Azure_DBforMySQL_AuthZ_Firewall_Deny_AzureServices_Access](https://github.com/azsk/AzTS-docs/blob/main/Control%20coverage/Feature/DBForMySql.md#azure_dbformysql_authz_firewall_deny_azureservices_access)

* Following control has been updated in Azure Tenant Scanner:
    * [Azure_Subscription_Use_Only_Alt_Credentials](https://github.com/azsk/AzTS-docs/blob/main/Control%20coverage/Feature/SubscriptionCore.md) - Excluded guest/external accounts from control evaluation.
    * [Azure_SQLDatabase_SI_Remediate_Security_Vulnerabilities](https://github.com/azsk/AzTS-docs/blob/main/Control%20coverage/Feature/SQLServer.md#azure_sqldatabase_si_remediate_security_vulnerabilities) - Updated ASC (Azure Security Center) assessment as previous assessment is deprecated now.

* Control metadata update:
    * Updated _DisplayName_ property for control [Azure_SQLDatabase_DP_Enable_TDE](https://github.com/azsk/AzTS-docs/blob/main/Control%20coverage/Feature/SQLServer.md#azure_sqldatabase_dp_enable_tde).<br/>
    **Previous DisplayName:** Transparent data encryption (TDE) must be enabled.<br />
    **Updated DisplayName:** Enable Transparent Data Encryption on SQL databases.


### Bulk Remediation Script Updates
* Updated [Bulk Remediation Script](https://github.com/azsk/AzTS-docs/tree/main/Scripts/RemediationScripts) for following two controls to include remediation for Synapse Workspace resources.
    * Azure_SQLDatabase_Audit_Enable_Threat_Detection_Server
    * Azure_SQLDatabase_DP_Enable_TDE

## Tenant Scanner Framework Updates
* Added telemetry to capture role definition/permission details:
    Towards having visibility on types of roles (native, custom) being used across the tenant, we have enhanced the scope of the AzTS telemetry to capture role definition and permission details.

* Released initial versions of exposed APIs for On-Demand scan.

* Leverage ARM APIs for PIM based controls in AzTS:
    * This change would enable visibility to resource level PIM access as against RG level earlier.<br/>
    _Note:_ This feature has been released with the feature flag turned as off. 

## Other Improvements/Bug fixes

* **AzTS UI fix:** Overflow error for _'Did You Know'_ section in UI. 
* **AzTS control fix:** Updated status reason to highlight reasons for control failure of control 'Azure_SQLDatabase_Audit_Enable_Threat_Detection_Server'.
