# AzTS MMA Discovery and Removal Utility

-----------------------------------------------------------------
## Overview 

AzTS MMA Discovery and Removal Utility can be used to remove MMA extension/agent from Azure Virtual Machine (VMs) across subscriptions. Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) [will be retired on 31 August 2024](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/were-retiring-the-log-analytics-agent-in-azure-monitor-on-31-august-2024/) and users need to migrate to Azure Monitor agent (AMA). If you have already migrated all of your Virtual Machines (VMs) to start using AMA for monitoring, it is recommened to remove MMA agent to avoid duplication of logs.

AzTS MMA Discovery and Removal Utility can help to remove MMA extension from VMs which already have AMA extension present, in bulk/at tenant scale in centralized manner instead of doing it per VM manually.

## How does it work?

AzTS MMA Discovery and Removal Utility works in two phases:
1. Discovery Phase
2. Removal Phase

**1- Discovery Phase**

In this phase, it will prepare the inventory of all Virtual Machines and their extensions to identify, which VMs have both MMA and AMA or only MMA agents installed. In next phase (i.e., 'Removal Phase'), users can choose to remove MMA extension from VMs having either both MMA and AMA agents or just MMA agent. 

It is recommended to avoid creating new VMs with MMA extension or installing MMA extension on existing VMs after AzTS MMA Discovery and Removal utility starts processing. For this you can assign Azure policy with 'Deny' effect on your subscriptions before running this utility. Guidance for same is available [here] (link).

**2- Removal Phase**

VMs having both MMA and AMA agents are picked up in this phase for removal of MMA extensions. Users have the option to disable this phase, and enable/run it after validating the inventory of VMs list prepared in the Discovery phase.
Users also have the option to run this phase on VMs which have just MMA agents (But recommended approach is to first migrate all dependencies to AMA agent and then remove MMA agent).

## Installation

Please follow the steps provided [here](./SingleTenantSetupInstallation.md), to install and configure AzTS MMA Discovery and Removal utility.

## FAQs

### **1. At what scope(s) can the AzTS MMA Discovery and Removal utility run?** 
The AzTS MMA Discovery and Removal utility is highly flexible and configurable. It allows you to choose the desired scope(s) where you want to run the utility. You can configure it to operate at selected subscription scopes, specific management group scopes, the entire tenant, or even across multiple tenants.

### **2. What permissions does the AzTS MMA Discovery and Removal utility require?** 
To operate effectively, the AzTS MMA Discovery and Removal utility creates a remediation identity. The specific permissions required for this identity depend on the scope and context. In the case of a single tenant, a user-assigned managed identity with the 'Reader' and 'Virtual Machine Contributor' roles is used. For multi-tenant scopes, an Azure AD App/SPN is employed. It is essential to grant the appropriate permissions to this identity at the configured scopes for successful execution.

### **3. After MMA agents have been removed from all VMs, should I clean up the setup?**
Once all MMA agents have been successfully removed from the VMs, it is recommended to perform a cleanup of the setup resources. It is important to note that while you may want to delete the setup resources, it is advisable to retain any inventory or process logs for future reference. The cleanup steps have been provided [here](./SetupCleanUp.md) in the documentation.

### **4. What's the cost of running the AzTS MMA Discovery and Removal Utility?**
Estimated average cost for a single run (both discovery and removal phase) of utility on a scope of approx 100K VMs is less than 5$.
It is important to consider that if you choose to retain inventory or process logs, the cost may increase depending on the selected retention period.

### **5. How much time AzTS MMA Discovery and Removal Utility will take to remove MMA agnets?**
Estimated average time required for a single run (both discovery and removal phase) of utility on a scope of approx 100K VMs is around 30 Mins.

### **6. How I can get list of all the VMs available in configured scope(s)?**
VMs inventory is collected in Log Analytics workspace. To list all VMs discovered by utility, go to Log Analytics workspace created during setup --> Select Logs and run following query: 

``` KQL
Inventory_CL
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| where ResourceType =~ "VirtualMachine"
| summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated,*) by ResourceId = tolower(ResourceId)
| extend OSType = tostring(parse_json(Metadata_s).OSType)
```

### **7. How I can get list of all the VMs which have both MMA & AMA agent present and are eligible for removal phase?**
VMs and Extensions inventory is collected in Log Analytics workspace. To list all the VMs which have both MMA & AMA agent present, go to Log Analytics workspace created during setup --> Select Logs and run following query: 

``` KQL
let timeago = timespan(7d);
let virtualMachines = Inventory_CL
| where TimeGenerated > ago(timeago)
| where ResourceType =~ "VirtualMachine"
| summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated,*) by ResourceId = tolower(ResourceId)
| extend  OSType = tostring(parse_json(Metadata_s).OSType)
| project VMResourceID = ResourceId, OSType;
let virtualMachinesExtensions = Inventory_CL
| where TimeGenerated > ago(timeago)
| where ResourceType =~ "VMExtension" and Source_s =~ "AzTS_05_VMExtensionInventoryProcessor"
| summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated,*) by ResourceId = tolower(ResourceId)
| extend VMResourceID = tolower(substring(ResourceId,0,indexof(ResourceId, '/', 0, -1, 9 )))
| extend ExtensionType = tostring(parse_json(Metadata_s).ExtensionType)
| project ResourceId, VMResourceID, ExtensionType;
let virtualMachinesWithBothExtensions = virtualMachines
| join kind=leftouter (virtualMachinesExtensions) on VMResourceID
| summarize Extensions = make_list(ExtensionType) by VMResourceID, OSType
|where (Extensions contains "MicrosoftMonitoringAgent" or Extensions contains "OmsAgentForLinux") and (Extensions contains "AzureMonitorWindowsAgent" or Extensions contains "AzureMonitorLinuxAgent");
virtualMachinesWithBothExtensions
```

### **7. How I can get list of all the VMs which MMA agent present?**
VMs and Extensions inventory is collected in Log Analytics workspace. To list all the VMs which have both MMA agent present, go to Log Analytics workspace created during setup --> Select Logs and run following query: 

``` KQL
let timeago = timespan(7d);
let virtualMachines = Inventory_CL
| where TimeGenerated > ago(timeago)
| where ResourceType =~ "VirtualMachine"
| summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated,*) by ResourceId = tolower(ResourceId)
| extend  OSType = tostring(parse_json(Metadata_s).OSType)
| project VMResourceID = ResourceId, OSType;
let virtualMachinesMMAExtensions = Inventory_CL
| where TimeGenerated > ago(timeago)
| where ResourceType =~ "VMExtension" and Source_s =~ "AzTS_05_VMExtensionInventoryProcessor"
| summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated,*) by ResourceId = tolower(ResourceId)
| extend VMResourceID = tolower(substring(ResourceId,0,indexof(ResourceId, '/', 0, -1, 9 )))
| extend ExtensionType = tostring(parse_json(Metadata_s).ExtensionType)
| where ExtensionType =~ "OmsAgentForLinux" or ExtensionType =~ "MicrosoftMonitoringAgent"
| project ResourceId, VMResourceID, ExtensionType, ExtensionResourceId = ResourceId;
let virtualMachinesWithMMAExtensions = virtualMachines
| join kind=inner  (virtualMachinesMMAExtensions) on VMResourceID
| project VMResourceID, OSType, ExtensionResourceId, ExtensionType;
virtualMachinesWithMMAExtensions
```
