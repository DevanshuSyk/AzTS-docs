> The Azure Tenant Security Solution (AzTS) was created by the Core Services Engineering & Operations (CSEO) division at Microsoft, to help accelerate Microsoft IT's adoption of Azure. We have shared AzTS and its documentation with the community to provide guidance for rapidly scanning, deploying and operationalizing cloud resources, across the different stages of DevOps, while maintaining controls on security and governance.
<br>AzTS is not an official Microsoft product â€“ rather an attempt to share Microsoft CSEO's best practices with the community..

## Overview

Tenant reader solution provides a UI-based tool that can be used to perform on-demand scans to verify your fixes sooner, check reasons for control failures and view latest scan results. This tool leverages you current subscription permissions to show you subscriptions that you have the ability to request scans for. 

## Prerequisite

1. Signed in user must have one of the following permission at subscription or resource group scope: Owner, Contributor, ServiceAdministrator, CoAdministrator, AccountAdministrator, Security Reader, Security Admin.
2. Subscription scan should have completed for the day. The steps to validate this has been specified under [this section](/01-Setup%20and%20getting%20started/README.md#steps-3-of-3-verify-azts-ui-is-working-as-expected).

> **Note:**
> 1. If you have been recently granted access, you either need to wait for the next scheduled scan to read the latest RBAC data or request an existing owner of a subscription to perform an ad hoc scan for the subscription using AzTS UI.
