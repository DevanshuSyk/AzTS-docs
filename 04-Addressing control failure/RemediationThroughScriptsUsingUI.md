> The Azure Tenant Security Solution (AzTS) was created by the Core Services Engineering & Operations (CSEO) division at Microsoft, to help accelerate Microsoft IT's adoption of Azure. We have shared AzTS and its documentation with the community to provide guidance for rapidly scanning, deploying and operationalizing cloud resources, across the different stages of DevOps, while maintaining controls on security and governance.
<br>AzTS is not an official Microsoft product â€“ rather an attempt to share Microsoft CSEO's best practices with the community.

Next time, when you open AzTS UI, you will see Remediation Mode toggle button.
![RemdiationMode](../Images/04_Autoremdiation_RemediationMode.png)

It is turned off on UI load by default. Currently only few controls are supported for AutoRemediation. You can find list for such controls [here](../Scripts/RemediationScripts/ControlsEligibleForRemediationThroughUI.md).

Once you turn on Remediation mode, you will get option to select failing controls(from above list available for remediation through UI). You can select multiple such failing controls and from Action button, download zipped folder containing scripts and other files necessary for remediation.Detailed steps about using this zip folder for remediation can be found [here](../Scripts/RemediationScripts/Instructions.pdf).
