# Getting Started with the AzTS REST API 

## Introduction

The Azure Tenant Security Solution (AzTS) provides REST APIs which can be leveraged to scan subscription(s) and get control scan result for subscription(s). This is alternative for AzTS UI to get insights about security compliance from AzTS perspective.
